##Tutorials
 [Lynda.com](www.lynda.com) is a library of tutorials on almost anything. We have access through ISU.  
 
 One recommended tutorial:
 
 [Up and running with R](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/Up-Running-R/120612-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a12%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3aR+essential+training%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2)

##Tutorials

There are also interactive tutorials as well. Most are free for beginners, but may require payment for advanced sessions (~$25/month)  

So far, I really like [DataCamp](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-3-matrices-3?ex=3)  

Your advisor has $300 laying around.  

##swirl  

[Learn R, in R](http://swirlstats.com/)  

```{r swirl, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")  
```   

```{r, hi swirl, warning=FALSE}
library(swirl)
```  

##Courses and workshops on campus

##  
You won't get good help if you don't put effort into the asking.

##Asking good questions  
If you are getting help online, you absolutely must create a reproducible example.  

  * You will not get an answer until you do this.  
  * This is not trivial.  
  * Good exercise in thinking about your problem.  
  * Half the time helpers won't know if their code actually works unless they can run it.  
  
**Repr**oducible **ex**ample is also called a **reprex**  

#Steps to asking a good question  

##Step 1. Do your homework.  
* Read the basics related to what you are doing.  
    + `?()` in console  
    + Online documentation, vignettes  
* Check if some one else has asked the same question.  
    + Google  
    + StackOverflow is usually well covered by google, but sometimes searching specifically in the site works better.  
    
People are more willing to give you their time if they can see that you put time in yourself.  

##Step 2. Provide example data.  
* Use a built-in dataset `library(help = "datasets")`  
* Generate a dummy dataframe
```{r, dataframe}  
Data <- data.frame(
    X = sample(1:10),
    Y = sample(c("yes", "no"), 10, replace = TRUE)
)  
```  
* If the problem is with your dataset itself, provide some of the data by using `head()` for the first 6 rows and `dput()` to describe the structure.  

##Step 3. Provide minimal code.  
* Show everyone what you tried and point out where you think the problem is  
* Use only as much code as you have to - have any conversions done before you post  
* Make sure they have everything to run the code  
    + Include packages (`library())`)
    + May want to include R and Rstudio versions (`rstudioapi::versionInfo()`)
    + Make sure they can run your code  
    + `reprex` package   
    
#You probably solved your problem by now  
   
##Step 4. Steel yourself.  
* People online can be insensitive and callous  
    + They still mean well  
    + Different backgrounds result in different tones
    + Help is help  
* Admit if you did not follow Steps1-3 well  
    + Turn the other cheek
    + Get over yourself
    + Edit your question 
    + Do better next time
