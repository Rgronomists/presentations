 [A book for those who want to improve programming skills and understanding of the R language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)  
 
##An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R  

I have not read this, it looks good.

##Tutorials
 [Lynda.com](www.lynda.com) is a library of tutorials on almost anything. We have access through ISU.  
 
 One recommended tutorial:
 
 [Up and running with R](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/Up-Running-R/120612-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a12%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3aR+essential+training%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2)

##Tutorials

There are also interactive tutorials as well. Most are free for beginners, but may require payment for advanced sessions (~$25/month)  

So far, I really like [DataCamp](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-3-matrices-3?ex=3)  

Your advisor has $300 laying around.  

##swirl  

[Learn R, in R](http://swirlstats.com/)  

```{r swirl, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")  
```   

```{r, hi swirl, warning=FALSE}
library(swirl)
```  

##Courses and workshops on campus  
* STAT 579: Introduction to R (especially if Heike Hoffman is teaching)  
* [STAT 585: Data Technologies for Statistical Analysis](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/index)  
* [AGRON 590: Data Stewardship](http://agron590-isu.github.io/)
* [Week of R](http://heike.github.io/rwrks/)

##  
You won't get good help if you don't put effort into the asking.

##Asking good questions  
If you are getting help online, you absolutely must create a reproducible example.  

  * You will not get an answer until you do this.  
  * This is not trivial.  
  * Good exercise in thinking about your problem.  
  * Half the time helpers won't know if their code actually works unless they can run it.
