## Tidyverse  
* A place where people and their mental well-being are valued.  
* Welcoming to non-programmers.  
* Seeks to be a utopia of data science.  
* One of many R universes. My favorite.  

##Philosophy best explained by creator  

Hadley Wickham's talk from UseR! 2016 [Tools for tidy data](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Towards-a-grammar-of-interactive-graphics)

## Best way to learn the tidyverse

##What is it? 
Collection of R packages designed to work around a [common philosophy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html).

## Tidy data  

 <center><img src="images/tidy_1.png" width="800px" /></center>  
 
 * Each variable must have its own column.    
 * Each observation must have its own row.  
 * Each value must have its own cell.  

## Why tidy data  

* Consistent data structure allows easier learning of related tools because they have an underlying uniformity  
* Placing variables in columns takes advantage of R's vectorized nature  
* [Hadley's tidy data publication](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)


##  Very easy to find data that is well organized, but not tidy 

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE }
df<-data.frame(property=c("pH", "NO3", "clay", "silt", "sand"),
                    five_cm = c(7, 35, 20, 20, 60),
                    ten_cm = c(6.7, 22, 20, 20, 60),
                    fifteen_cm = c(6.5, 20, 20, 20, 60),
                    twenty_cm = c(6.4, 18, 20, 20, 60),
                   stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

soil<-as_tibble(df)
soil
```

Plot the change in pH across depth?

##  `gather`  
When column names are *values* instead of variables, we need to `gather` 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
soil
```

* We need to know:  
* The columns that are the values that need to be incorporated  
* The name of the variable for the values, here it is `depth`. This is the `key`.  


##  `gather`  
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
soil
```

> * The name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells. This is the  `value`. If you know what it is, name it (NO3ppm). If you have many mixed units, you can use `value = value` or `value = measured` etc.

## `gather`  
```{r}
tidy_soil<-gather(soil, five_cm, ten_cm, fifteen_cm, twenty_cm, 
                  key=depth, value=value)
tidy_soil
```

##  
```{r}
filter(tidy_soil, property == "pH")%>%
ggplot(aes(x=factor(depth, levels = c("five_cm", "ten_cm", "fifteen_cm", "twenty_cm")), y=value))+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  labs(x="depth", y="pH")
```
  

##  See also  `spread`

Use this if one of your columns is full of what could be headers
```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
crops<-read_csv("data/NASS-Iowa.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
oats<-(crops[crops$Commodity == "OATS", c(2, 16, 17, 20)])  
head(oats)
```

* Now column that includes the variable names is `key`, here it is `Data Item`.  
* Column that contains the values is the `value` column, here they already have it as `Value` 


#%>%  

## `%>%` moves or "pipes" the result forward into the next function  

`f(x)` is the same as `x %>% f()`  


  *assumes the first input/argument the function wants is the data set  
`ggplot(df, aes(x = this, y = values))`  

vs  

`df %>% ggplot(aes(x = this, y = values))`  

## Much easier to read  
Regular code chunks work from inside out  
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
finally_last_step(
  and_then_third(
    then_second(
      do_first(data)
    )
  )
)
```  

Piping uses intuitive ordering  
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE} 
data%>%
  do_first()%>%
  then_second()%>%
  and_then_third()%>%
  finally_last_step()  
```  

##  Example 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
biomass<-data.frame(trt = c("0", "100", "130", "150"),
               block = c("A", "A", "A", "A"),
                    part=c("leaf", "stem", "fruit", "root"),
                    may = c(5.5, 5.7, 0, 12.0),
                    june = c(7.5, 6.7, 2.0, 14.0),
                    july = c(12.5, 7.7, 8.2, 22.5),
                    august = c(12.5, 7.7, 8.8, 22.0),
                   stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

biomass<-as_tibble(biomass)
biomass

```  
Which columns need to be incorporated?  
What is the `key`?  
What is the `value`?  

##  
```{r}
gather(biomass, may, june, july, august, key = month, value = g_m2)
```  

##  
```{r}
gather(biomass, may, june, july, august, key = month, value = g_m2)%>%
  group_by(part, month)%>%
  summarise(avg = mean(g_m2))
```


##More Examples  
The next two examples have non-tidyverse equivalents [here](http://agron590-isu.github.io/lab/week_07/dataframes/script_dataframes.R).  

These examples come from a nice ag dataset available from the [National Agricultural Statitistics Service](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/). I've selected data that focuses on field crops in Iowa.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(crops)
```


##Corn "eras"
We read this dataframe in above as "crops"
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
crops%>%
  select(Year, State, Commodity, `Data Item`, Value)%>%   
  rename(Data = `Data Item`, bu_acre = Value)%>%         
  filter(Year > 1866, 
         Data == "CORN, GRAIN - YIELD, MEASURED IN BU / ACRE")%>% 
  mutate(era = ifelse ((Year %in% c(1867:1940)), "prehybrid",     
                        ifelse((Year %in% c(1941:1990)), "old",    
                                ifelse ((Year %in% c(1991:2015)), 
                                        "new", "nope"))))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=bu_acre, group=era, color=era))+                    
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

  filter(Commodity %in% c("OATS", "BARLEY", "WHEAT", "RYE", "SOYBEANS") &

  summarise(total=sum(Value))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=total, group=size, color=size))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  ggtitle("Changes in small grain and soybean acres in Iowa")+
  labs(y="Total acres harvested")
```
